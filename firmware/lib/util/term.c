/*
 * Receive a character from the UART Rx.
 *
 * This features a simple line-editor that allows to delete and
 * re-edit the characters entered, until either CR or NL is entered.
 * Printable characters entered will be echoed using term_putchar().
 *
 * Editing characters:
 *
 * . \b (BS) or \177 (DEL) delete the previous character
 * . ^u kills the entire input buffer
 * . ^w deletes the previous word
 * . ^r sends a CR, and then reprints the buffer
 * . \t will be replaced by a single space
 *
 * All other control characters will be ignored.
 *
 * The internal line buffer is RX_BUFSIZE (80) characters long, which
 * includes the terminating \n (but no terminating \0).  If the buffer
 * is full (i. e., at RX_BUFSIZE-1 characters in order to keep space for
 * the trailing \n), any further input attempts will send a \a to
 * term_putchar() (BEL character), although line editing is still
 * allowed.
 *
 * Input errors while talking to the UART will cause an immediate
 * return of -1 (error indication).  Notably, this will be caused by a
 * framing error (e. g. serial line "break" condition), by an input
 * overrun, and by a parity error (if parity was enabled and automatic
 * parity recognition is supported by hardware).
 *
 * Successive calls to term_getchar() will be satisfied from the
 * internal buffer until that buffer is emptied again.
